# Linux Commands Notes

The document contains all important Linux commands which students used during their terminal training and their first cybersecurity lab work. Students will learn the command functions and syntax and the practical applications which they will use to learn Linux system operation.

Students used these commands to practice system operations through hands-on exercises which included beginner-level challenges like OverTheWire Bandit.

What I learned: Using `cd -` quickly switches back to the previous directory.

---

## Command: pwd
What it does: Prints the current working directory  
Syntax: `pwd`

- `-n` → show line numbers

What I learned: Often used together with pipes.

Example:

`cat log.txt | grep error`

---

Syntax: `less file`  
Example: `less /var/log/syslog`

What I learned: Press `q` to exit.

---

## Command: head
What it does: Shows the first lines of a file  
Syntax: `head [options] file`  
Example: `head -n 10 rockyou.txt`

Useful flags:
- `-n` → number of lines

---

## Command: tail
What it does: Shows the last lines of a file  
Syntax: `tail [options] file`  
Example: `tail -n 20 log.txt`

Useful flags:
- `-f` → follow updates in real time

What I learned: `tail -f` is useful when monitoring logs.

---

## Command: grep
What it does: Searches for specific text patterns  
Syntax: `grep [options] pattern file`  
Example: `grep password notes.txt`

Useful flags:
- `-i` → ignore case  
- `-r` → recursive search  
- `-n` → show line numbers  

What I learned: `grep` becomes very powerful when combined with pipes.

Example:

`cat access.log | grep 404`

---

## Command: find
What it does: Searches for files or directories  
Syntax: `find [path] [options]`  
Example: `find . -name "*.txt"`

Useful flags:
- `-name` → search by filename  
- `-type` → specify file type  
- `-size` → search by file size  

What I learned: Useful when files are buried deep in directories.

---

## Command: chmod
What it does: Changes file permissions  
Syntax: `chmod permissions file`  
Example: `chmod 755 script.sh`

What I learned: `755` allows owner full access but only read/execute for others.

---

## Command: chown
What it does: Changes file ownership  
Syntax: `chown user:group file`  
Example: `sudo chown root:root config.txt`

Useful flags:
- `-R` → recursive ownership change

---

## Command: whoami
What it does: Displays the current logged-in user  
Syntax: `whoami`
